📱 High Voltage Line Sag Calculation App
🧠 R&D Project · Electrical Engineering · Flutter Multiplatform
This project focuses on developing a multiplatform mobile application (Android, iOS, and Web) using Flutter, specialized in the calculation of cable sag (curvature) in high-voltage power lines.
It is designed for use by electrical engineers and field technicians, enabling fast and accurate calculations both in the office and on-site, without requiring an internet connection.

🎯 Project Objectives
✅ Specialized Technical Application
Develop an intuitive, efficient, and accessible Flutter app for real-time conductor sag calculations.

✅ High Accuracy
Implement advanced formulas, including the catenary equation, to ensure reliable results under real-world conditions.

✅ International Unit Support
Allow users to work with either metric or imperial systems, with automatic conversion of inputs and outputs.

✅ Efficient User Interface
Design a clean, minimalist UI suitable for fieldwork environments.

✅ Full Mobility
Enable offline use, eliminating the need for complex equipment or network access.

⚙️ Key Technical Features
📐 Real-Time Unit Conversion
Seamless switching between meters/feet and decimal/sexagesimal degrees with dynamic result updates.

📊 Advanced Sag Calculations
Based on real conductor behavior models (weight, tension, span, inclination, temperature...).

📏 Smart Angle Handling
Supports both decimal and sexagesimal degrees, with integrated conversion tools.

📈 Clear and Actionable Results
Structured and easy-to-interpret output, adapted to technical use cases.

📴 Offline Functionality
Ideal for remote areas: all calculations are performed locally on the device.

🧰 Technologies Used
💙 Flutter – Cross-platform UI (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop)
💻 Dart – Programming language
🧮 Custom calculation engine based on structural and physical equations
☁️ (Optional) Firebase for authentication or data storage if integrated

🚧 Project Status
🔧 Under active development – MVP in progress
Currently building the core calculation logic, UI integration, and field testing modules.
